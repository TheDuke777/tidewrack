All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added
- Saved worlds: start several worlds and pick one to continue from the new
  world list. Progress saves automatically after every action, so closing the
  app (or Android closing it) never loses anything.
- Delete a world from the list (with confirmation).
- If a save file is ever damaged, the world is restored from one of its recent
  backups.

### Changed
- "New run" is replaced by "New world" on the world list; the game screen has a
  back button to return to it.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-03

### Changed
- Game data now comes from content files that are validated when the app starts;
  if they ever fail to load, the app explains why instead of showing a blank screen.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added
- First playable slice: explore "The First Descent", a hand-authored seven-room
  dungeon. Move between rooms, look around, wait, and start a new run; rooms you
  have visited show by name on their exits.
- Game core: seeded random number generator, entity-component store, event bus,
  and turn loop.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-11-03

- Testing pre-release builds.

## [0.0.3-beta.1] - 2026-11-03

  GitHub Releases, and `tools/release.py` for version bumps and tagging.
